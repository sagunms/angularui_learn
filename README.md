# Better Web Apps With AngularUI

Here angularui/template is the barebones template used by other test projects.

## Installation (example: angularui/template)
```
cd angularui/template
npm install
bower install
```

## To start server without Node (example: angular/template)
I know this is stupid. Better use Node to start server.
```
cd angularui/template/public
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now go to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
